# Data-Analysis-Report-of-Startups
In this task I was given an excel file having the data of startups which were called by our colleagues and their reamrks after calling them were mentioned in the file. My task was to analyse this data to find some loopholes in our process of approaching the startups according to the remarks.
I have plotted some graphs and pie charts to analyse the data. Jupyter notebooks and reports are attached.
I used matplotlib to plot charts.

Ahteshmul.xlsx contains the example of the file that was given to us.
###Remarks.xlsx has the remarks converted into numbers according to the categories.
